# ECE technology web project by Yven Shue and Philippe Rambaud

## Introduction

This project was made by yven Shue and Philippe Rambaud. In this project, you can create an account and login in a session. 
There, you can add metrics and show them in a graphic in collumns.

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sergkudinov/ece-nodejs-3-leveldb.git
cd ece-nodejs-3-leveldb
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm run start
```

## Negative points

This project has some errors:
1. When you show your metrics, the application crash.
2. We couldn't pass the user metrics in the graph. (none of us were familiar with ejs and we never did htlm so it was difficult to do both nodejs project and ejs)
3. We didn't put CSS because we lacked time to do it, so the app is not "beautiful"
4. There are no alerts when you add a metrics or when you register
5. The app is not pre-populate

## Used material

For this project, we used the course for almost everything. Connection, registering...
We took a sample of the ejs graph that we wanted to use on google.
